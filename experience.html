OTHER THAN THAT I CAN LEARNT MORE SUCH AS HOW TO MAKE SURE THEY ALWAYS FEEL COMFORTABLE, MANAGE FEEDING TIME PERFECTLY AND TAKING CARE IF THEY GET THE FEVER, INJURED AND STOMACHACHE. IT JUST WONDERFUL TO FEELING LIKE A MOM THAT LOOKS AFTER HER CHILDREN AND FROM THAT ALSO I CAN UNDERSTAND HOW HARD, TIRED AND DISCIPLINE TO BE A MOM.

		<td bgcolor="WHITE" align="justify">TAPPING. EVERY HOLIDAY I AND MY LITTLE BROTHER GO TO THE GARDEN WHERE THERE ARE SO MANY RUBBER TREE, FRUITS TREES AND MANY MORE PLANTS AND I JUST TAPPING ONLY. IT CAN HELP ME TO COLLECT THE MONEY AND FROM THAT I CAN BUY ANYTHING THAT I WANT. HERE I LEARNT SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO BE INDEPENDENT, BE HARDWORKING, BE GRATEFUL AND ALWAYS APPRECIATE WHAT MY DAD DID BEFORE FOR ME. HE JUST A RUBBER TAPPER BUT HE CAN FUNDING MY EDUCATION AND SPORTS.I ONCE HAD AN INJURY WHERE I FELL WHILE DRIVING MY MOTORCYCLE TO THE GARDEN BECAUSE THERE IS NO FLAT ROAD AND IT IS BIG ROCK, HOLLY AND HILLLY. IT IS VERY CHALLENGING FOR ME. ONCE UPON A DAY I STOPPED MY JOURNEY TO GO TO THE GARDEN BECAUSE I WAS SCARED BUT IT DID NOT HELP ME IN THE LITTLE BIT TO EARN MONEY. IT WAS A VERY HARD EXPERIENCE IN MY LIFE BUT I CAN HANDLE THAT PROBLEM TODAY</td>

		<td bgcolor="WHITE" align="justify">SALOON TREATMENT. I WORKED FOR ONE YEAR AND EVERY MONTH MY SALARY IS ONLY RM600 RINGGIT ONLY BECAUSE IT IS PAID ACCORDING TO THE SKILLS WE HAVE AND THE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS ATTENDING. MY SKILLS IN THIS FIELD ARE HAIR WASHING, FACE AND REBONDING. THROUGH THIS JOURNEY I LEARNED A LOT AND IT WAS VERY CHALLENGING PLUS THE BOSS IS CHINESE. SHE IS VERY STRICT AND CONSIDERS TIME.WORKED FOR ONE YEAR AND EVERY MONTH MY SALARY IS ONLY RM600 RINGGIT ONLY BECAUSE IT IS PAID ACCORDING TO THE SKILLS WE HAVE AND THE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS ATTENDING. MY SKILLS IN THIS FIELD ARE HAIR WASHING, FACE, AND REBONDING. THROUGH THIS JOURNEY I LEARNED A LOT AND IT WAS VERY CHALLENGING PLUS THE BOSS IS CHINESE. SHE IS VERY STRICT AND CONSIDERS TIME. IN ADDITION, I ALSO FACED THE RISK WHERE I WAS TOLD BY MRS. LIM TO CUTTING A CUSTOMER'S HAIR WITHOUT ANY BASIC SKILL AND THIS WAS ALSO WRONG BECAUSE A WORKER SHOULD BE GIVEN TRAINING AND LEARNING FIRST. IF THE WORKERS CAN MASTER THE SKILLS, THEY DEFINITELY HAVE NO WORRIES AND RISKS IN PROVIDING SERVICE. HERE I EXPERIENCED A CONFLICT AND I DECIDED TO STOP WORKING THERE BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND IT IS NOT EASY FOR CUSTOMERS TO LOOK FOR INCOME AND PAY TO GET GOOD SERVICE. IT WOULDN'T BE AN ISSUE IF I WAS TRAINED AND TEACHED BUT THERE WAS NO SUCH ACTION FROM HIM AND HE JUST TOLD ME TO CUT THE BOYFRIEND'S HAIR. TO AVOID THE PROBLEM BECOMING COMPLICATED, I STOPPED TO WORK. IT WAS A SWEET EXPERIENCE MIXED WITH PAIN IN MY LIFE.</td>
