	<p style="color:black"; face="Harrington">FAMILY IS SOMETHING VERY TO ALL OF US BECAUSE WITH THEM WE CAN FEEL LOVE AND ATTENTION. THEY ARE ALSO THE FIRST PERSON TO HELP US IF WE HAVE A PROBLEM. NOT EVERYONE IN THIS WORLD HAS A FAMILY AND THERE ARE ALSO OF THOSE WHO HAVE A FAMILY BUT COME FROM A BROKEN FAMILY SO APPRECIATE OUR FAMILY MEMBERS AND RESPECT THEM. THIS IS MY FAMILY. I HAVE FOUR SIBLINGS INCLUDING ME. I HAVE ONE SISTER AND 2 BROTHERS. MY BROTHER IS 15 YEARS OLD AND THE YOUNGEST IS 9 YEARS OLD WHILE MY SISTER IS 13 YEARS OLD. BEING THE ELDEREST IS ONE OF THE BIG RESPONSIBILITIES IN WHICH I HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF THEM AND ADVISE THEM OFTEN BECAUSE MY MOTHER AND FATHER DO NOT UNDERSTAND TO TEACH THEM CURRENTLY LEARNING AND THEY ARE BUSY COMMITTING TO WORK.

		<P>MY FATHER IS TENGAH BIN CHEY BENG AND HE IS 47 YEARS OLD WORKING AS A RUBBER TAPPER. HE IS A LOVING FATHER AND RESPECTED BY ALL THE VILLAGERS BUT HE IS ALSO A STRICT PERSON. I CAN HONESTLY SAY HIS DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES TO THE FAMILY ARE VERY GOOD. NEXT MUST BE MY HEAVEN THAT IS MY MOTHER. MY MOTHER IS 45 YEARS OLD AND IS KNOWN AS ROHANI BINTI KINTAN. SHE IS A FULL-TIME HOUSEWIFE SOMETIMES SHE ALSO HELPS MY FATHER WORK. BETWEEN THE ATTITUDE OF SENIORITY, PERSEVERANCE AND NOT GIVING UP ON HERSELF HE OPENED MY EYES WHERE I REALIZED HOW PAINFUL AND TIRED THE MOTHER WAS TAKING CARE OF US BUT SHE STILL CARRIED OUT HER RESPONSIBILITIES. MY MOTHER IS THE ELDERLY CHILD AMONG HER SIBLINGS AND OF COURSE, SHE WAS VERY CAREFUL IN EDUCATING US EVEN THOUGH WE LACK COMMITMENT TO LESSONS. THESE ARE HER WORDS WHEN GIVING ME ADVICE "I'M NOT A STUDYING MOTHER AND I CAN'T GIVE YOU LUXURIES LIKE OTHER PARENTS CAN GIVE TO THEIR CHILDREN BUT DO YOUR BEST IN CARRYING OUT YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES AS A CHILD ALSO A STUDENT BECAUSE MOTHER WANTS TO SEE YOU HAPPY AND MOTHER DOESN'T ASK FOR ANYTHING FROM YOU". HERE I STATE THAT I AM VERY LUCKY TO HAVE THEM IN MY LIFE AND GOD'S PLAN IS VERY BEAUTIFUL. I AM NOT A MUSLIM BUT I BELIEVE THAT ALLAH EXISTS AND GIVES ME A VERY PRECIOUS OPPORTUNITY IN MY LIFE.


			<P> IN CONCLUSION, MY FAMILY MEMBERS ARE THE FIRST PEOPLE THAT I POINT ATTENTION TO AND I REALLY LOVE THEM VERY MUCH. AS THE ELDERLY CHILD AND SISTER AMONG MY SIBLINGS, I AM READY TO TAKE ON MY RESPONSIBILITIES EVEN IF I AM TIRED, SICK, OR LACKING. THIS IS ALL BECAUSE I FEEL GRATEFUL AND MY LIFE ONLY KNOWS TO LOVE THEM. FINALLY. AS RESPONSIBLE AND RATIONAL HUMANS WE SHOULD TAKE AND EXECUTE OUR RESPONSIBILITIES NO MATTER WHAT WE ARE AMONG THE FAMILY MEMBERS. MY HOPE IS THAT MY FAMILY WILL ALWAYS BE BLESSED BY ALLAH AND FORGIVE THEIR SINS WHETHER THEY ARE COMMITTED CONSCIOUSLY OR UNCONSCIOUSLY AS WELL AS ALWAYS BE HEALTHY AND SAFE.
